\arguments{
\item{conc_df}{dataframe of gas concentration over time}

\item{conc_col}{column with gas concentration}

\item{datetime_col}{column with datetime of each concentration measurement
Note that if there are duplicated datetime in the same f_fluxid only
the first row will be kept}

\item{f_start}{column with datetime when the measurement started}

\item{f_end}{column with datetime when the measurement ended}

\item{f_fluxid}{column with ID of each flux}

\item{start_cut}{time to discard at the start of the measurements
(in seconds)}

\item{end_cut}{time to discard at the end of the measurements (in seconds)}

\item{t_zero}{time at which the slope should be calculated}
}
\value{
a df with the modeled gas concentration, slope, intercept,
std error, r square and p value of the quadratic model
}
\description{
