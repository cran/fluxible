\usage{
flux_fortify(
  slopes_df,
  f_conc,
  f_datetime,
  f_ylim_upper,
  f_ylim_lower,
  f_facetid,
  y_text_position
)
}
\arguments{
\item{slopes_df}{dataset containing slopes,
with flags produced by \link[fluxible:flux_quality]{flux_quality}}

\item{f_conc}{column with gas concentration}

\item{f_datetime}{column with datetime of each data point}

\item{f_ylim_upper}{y axis upper limit}

\item{f_ylim_lower}{y axis lower limit}

\item{f_facetid}{character vector of columns to use as facet IDs. Note that
they will be united, and that has to result in a unique facet ID for each
measurement. Default is \code{f_fluxid}}
