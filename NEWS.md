# fluxible 1.3.3

* citation: paper published!

# fluxible 1.3.2

* `flux_plot`: fixed a bug, which makes it now much faster

# fluxible 1.3.1

* Vignettes and readme: reference and small fixes

# fluxible 1.3.0

* `flux_match`: checks that the two inputs have different column names
* `flux_plot`: dots in legend and lines bigger
* `flux_fitting`: `exp_zhao18` now default model
* various fixes and code improvements

# fluxible 1.2.13

* `flux_fitting`: `cut_direction` allows to cut from both sides, or start, or end


# fluxible 1.2.12

* `flux_drygas`: does the wet air correction
* `flux_units`: added `mmol/mol` as a possible concentration unit
* `flux_diff`: calculates the difference between fluxes (GPP, transpiration, etc)

# fluxible 1.2.11

* `flux_calc`: fixed bug when `atm_pressure` is a variable

# fluxible 1.2.10

* `flux_lrc`: output is now in long format (fluxes in same column, additional column indicating PAR correction), which makes it easier to handle with `flux_gpp`.

# fluxible 1.2.9

* `flux_plot`: `output = "longpdf"` exports a single page pdf (default width 29.7 cm and as long as needed). This method is considerably faster than `pdfpages`, because it bypasses `facet_wrap_paginate`, but is a bit less aesthetic.

# fluxible 1.2.8

* `flux_plot`: `f_facetid` argument allows to display more information in the facet IDs when plotting

# fluxible 1.2.7

* `flux_match`: `fixed_length` is deprecated. `flux_match` will detect whether `end_col` or `measurement_length` are provided.

# fluxible 1.2.6

* `flux_calc`: gas concentration unit can be ppm, ppb or ppt. The conversion coefficient is integrated in `flux_units`

# fluxible 1.2.5

* `flux_calc`: `atm_pressure` is averaged like `temp_air_col` if it is a variable with more than one value per flux measurement

# fluxible 1.2.4

* `flux_units`: new function returning a conversion factor to transform fluxes into the desired unit
* `flux_calc`: `flux_unit` argument now takes units in the form amount/surface/time

# fluxible 1.2.3

* `flux_lrc`: new function to standardize CO2 fluxes with PAR values

# fluxible 1.2.2

* `flux_calc`:
  * `chamber_volume` and `tube_volume` are deprecated, use `setup_volume` instead
  * `cols_nest = "all"` allows to nest all the columns, to keep raw data
* `flux_match`:
  * `ratio_threshold` is deprecated, use `ratio_threshold` in  `flux_quality()` instead
  * `f_conc` is no longer needed, deprecated
* `flux_quality`: `ratio_threshold` default value is now 0.5, was 0 previously, which does not make sense

# fluxible 1.2.1

* `flux_quality`: new `no_slope` quality flag for when the model could not be fitted to the data.
* `flux_match`: `startcrop` argument is deprecated as `flux_fitting(start_cut)` has a similar function.

# fluxible 1.2.0

* `flux_calc`
  * variables in `cols_ave`, `cols_med` and and `cols_cum` gets suffix added so it is possible to provide a variable to several of those arguments.
  * `cols_nest`: new argument for variable to keep in a nested tibble after flux calculation.

# fluxible 1.1.2

* `flux_flag_count`: does not need the cut argument anymore, so it can also be used after calculating fluxes to provide a table with the number of measurements for each quality flag.

# fluxible 1.1.1

* `flux_gep`: deprecated, renamed into `flux_gpp` (does exactly the same).
* Fixed equations in documentation.

# fluxible 1.1.0

# fluxible 1.0.5

* `flux_quality`: fluxes with bad fit are now flagged as zero if their linear slope is below the minimal detectable slope (calculated as $2 \times \text{instrument error} / \text{length of flux}$) instead of discard.

# fluxible 1.0.4

* `flux_fitting`:
  - `exp_hm` to use the HM model (Pedersen et al., 2010; Hutchinson and Mosier, 1981).
  - returns the linear slope besides the chosen method.
* `flux_quality`: 
  - `kappamax = TRUE` to apply the kappamax method (HÃ¼ppi et al., 2018) on any of the exponential fits.
  - g-factor in the output shows the ratio of slope over the linear slope.
  - `force_linear` and `force_exp` to force the use of the linear or exponential slope (kappamax method).
* `flux_match`: option to feed a column with the end time instead of a fixed measurement length, in case fluxes do not all have the same length
* `flux_calc`:
  - `cols_sum` columns for which the values will be summed for each flux.
  - `cols_med` columns for which the median will be provided for each flux.

# fluxible 1.0.3

* `stupeflux`: a wrap function to directly process raw gas concentration data into ecosystem gas fluxes.
* `flux_fitting`: if `optim` returns non-finite values, the slope is NA and the function does not crash anymore.
* `flux_fitting`: new model `exp_tz`. Same as `exp_zhao18` except the user defines `t_zero`.

# fluxible 1.0.2

* `flux_gep`: fluxes presents in the dataset that are neither NEE nor ER (soilR, LRC or other) are not lost anymore.

# fluxible 1.0.1

* `flux_quality`: added `force_zero` argument to force a flux to be replaced by zero.

# fluxible 0.1.3

* Error corrected in `flux_gep`: the columns in the `cols_keep` argument are
  filled for GEP flux with values from NEE flux, and NA if missing,
  but not values from ER fluxes.

# fluxible 0.1.2

* `flux_gep` allows to keep all columns without naming them.
* Order of columns in the output of flux_match is more logical
  (f_start before f_end...).

# fluxible 0.1.1

* Vignettes temporarily back in Rmd until quarto_render bug is fixed
  (https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2830)

# fluxible 0.1.0

* Added a vignette describing how to prepare the data for `fluxible`.
* `flux_plot` now adds a vertical line showing where t_zero is.
* `flux_plot`: scale_x_datetime arguments are now past as a list.
* Functions now recycle user`s column names instead of renaming them.
  Columns created by fluxible functions have the suffix `f_`.

# fluxible 0.0.6

* Correction in `flux_quality`: `zero` and `discard` flags were inverted when
  using the linear fit.

# fluxible 0.0.5

* `flux_plot`: fixed the blurriness of quality flags.

# fluxible 0.0.4

* `flux_gep` function to calculate GEP.

# fluxible 0.0.3

* All plots are colored the same (colors code for raw concentration data points
  and fit and slope in black).
* Legend for line types in plots.
* Plot subtitles indicating the fit type.

# fluxible 0.0.2

* `flux_calc` allows to choose units.
* `flux_calc` allows plot area as a variable.
* `flux_fitting` with exponential model works when concentration data are
  missing in the middle of the measurement.
